# Dev setup

This will set you up for VersionPress development. üë©‚Äçüíª üë®‚Äçüíª

## Getting started

Our approach is:

- You develop in **local tools** you're comfortable with ‚Äì PhpStorm, vim, VSCode, ...
- Runtime is handled by **Docker**. You don't need MAMP / XAMPP, local installation of Selenium, etc.
- Common tasks are automated via **npm scripts**, for example, `npm run tests:full`.

If you're not familiar with Docker, this is [great quick start](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/). We also have some [tips for you](#docker-tips).

This software is expected on your machine:

- Git 2.10+
- Node.js 8+, npm 6+
- Docker 18.03+
- PHP 7+ and Composer 1.4+

### Windows users: use Git Bash

Git Bash (part of [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)) is required on Windows, please use it instead of `cmd.exe` / PowerShell for both interactive sessions and as your npm script shell:

```
npm config set script-shell "c:\Program Files\git\bin\bash.exe"
```

See also [Windows tips](#windows-tips) below.

## Project initialization

1. `git clone https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress`
2. `cd versionpress`
3. `npm install`

Have a ‚òï, this will take a while.

> **Tip**: From time to time, it's useful to clean up everything and pull latest Docker images. Run `npm run refresh-dev`.

## Dockerized development environment

To start a development site:

1. Make sure Docker is running and ports 80 and 3306 are free (no local MAMP / XAMPP / MySQL running).
2. Run `npm start`.

This will start a set of Docker containers in the background. When everything boots up, log into the test site at <http://localhost>, install WordPress and activate VersionPress on the _Plugins_ page. You're now all set up! üéâ

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/40431982-e2884a72-5ea8-11e8-9a07-e9857b5f1b67.png)

Let's explore your development environment:

- VersionPress source files are directly mapped to the site's `wp-content/plugins/versionpress`. Any changes you make locally are immediately live.
- Database can be inspected using [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) at <http://localhost:8099>, server name `mysql`, login `root` / `r00tpwd`. You can also use tools like MySQL Workbench or `mysql` command-line client, e.g., `mysql -u root -p`.
- WordPress root is mapped to `./dev-env/wp`. You can use your local Git client to inspect the site's history there.
- To invoke WP-CLI or Git commands in the site, create a terminal session via `docker-compose exec wordpress /bin/bash` or invoke the command directly, e.g., `docker-compose exec wordpress git log` or `docker-compose exec wordpress wp option update blogname "Hello"`.

Some useful tips for managing your Docker environment:

- `docker-compose ps` lists running containers
- `docker-compose logs -f` displays live logs
- `docker-compose logs wordpress` displays logs of a single service
- `docker stats` show live CPU / memory usage

See also [Docker tips](#docker-tips) below.

Run `npm stop` to stop the development environment. Run `npm run stop-and-cleanup` to also clean up WordPress files and MySQL database for a fresh start next time.

### PhpStorm setup

For PHP development, we recommend [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) and ship project files for it. The steps here have been tested in PhpStorm **2018.1**.

Run `npm run init-phpstorm`. This copies `.idea` to `plugins/versionpress`.

Open the `plugins/versionpress` project in PhpStorm. On the first start, you'll see two prompts:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/40103254-1e1bb46e-58ed-11e8-8fd3-42c47a504fa7.png)

**Enable WordPress support** but leave the installation path empty (ignore the warning):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/40103297-4420c96a-58ed-11e8-9bd7-8e36c8851a45.png)

Enable **Composer sync**.

For **Code Sniffer inspections** to work, there's a one-time configuration: Go to *Settings* > *Languages & Frameworks* > *PHP* > *Code Sniffer*, select *Local*, click the three dots next to it and provide your full system path to `./vendor/bin/phpcs`.

> **Note**: Most VersionPress code uses the [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) coding standard with only the parts directly interacting with WordPress using WordPress conventions. For example, global functions are defined as `vp_register_hooks()`, not `registerHooks()`.

It is also useful to **install the [EditorConfig](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7294?pr=phpStorm) extension**, VersionPress ships with some basic formatting rules.

### Writing code

Please refer to the [Contributing code](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-code) section in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Debugging

The development containers have [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/) installed and configured. Here is how to make debugging work in PhpStorm; the [Debugging tests](#starting-debugging-session-from-command-line) section gives an example of how to make debugging work in VSCode.

Start the Docker stack with `npm start`.

In PhpStorm, go to _Settings_ > _Languages & Frameworks_ > _PHP_ > _Servers_ and check the path mappings of the pre-configured _VersionPress-dev_ server. Specifically, update the WordPress mapping which PhpStorm does not persist automatically:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/40432492-1f2f7530-5eaa-11e8-91f2-8b3794f97b74.png)

The two mappings should be:

- `<your local path>/plugins/versionpress` -> `/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/versionpress`
- `<your local path>/ext-libs/wordpress` -> `/var/www/html`

The default zero configuration settings in _Settings_ > _Languages & Frameworks_ > _PHP_ > _Debug_ should be fine:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/26285067/34fefbd4-3e48-11e7-8f11-544507a1c5f7.png)

Enable debugging in the browser, most commonly using a [browser extension or a bookmarklet](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PhpStorm/Browser+Debugging+Extensions):

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/26764669/7f3e4dc0-496b-11e7-9dc2-10351d6378bc.png)

Place a breakpoint somewhere, e.g., in the main `versionpress.php` file, and start listening for debug connections in PhpStorm.

Reload a page in your browser. Debugging should now work:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/40105051-2cdd1524-58f2-11e8-8880-d50d70d4195f.png)

After you're done with debugging, run `npm stop` or `npm run stop-and-cleanup`.

## Testing

Tests are a significant part of the VersionPress project, we care about writing and maintaining them. They live in `plugins/versionpress/tests` and there are several types of them, from unit to full end2end tests. They all run in a dockerized test environment.

> **Note**: the `./frontend` app has its own tests, this section is about core VersionPress tests (PHP code) only.

### Dockerized testing environment

Similarly to the [development environment](#exploring-dockerized-environment), tests utilize Docker Compose as well. The main benefit is that you don't need to set up things like Selenium or Java locally.

Most tasks are scripted, for example, you just run `npm run tests:unit` but you can also drop to the raw Docker Compose mode and do things like `docker-compose run --rm tests ...`. In that case, one thing to understand is that there are two services in `docker-compose.yml` to choose from:

- `tests` ‚Äì just a test runner.
- `tests-with-wordpress` ‚Äì starts a WordPress stack.

All scripts also come with a `...:debug` version, for example, `tests:unit:debug`. See [Starting a debugging session from command line](#starting-debugging-session-from-command-line).

### Running tests from command line

1. Make sure you have run `npm install` as described above and have Docker running.
2. Run `npm run tests:unit` or `npm run tests:full`.

Unit tests use a simpler `tests` service and are fast to execute.

The full tests include [end2end tests](#end2end-tests) and are relatively slow to run, however, if they pass, there's a good chance that VersionPress works correctly.

#### Customizing what tests run

`tests:custom` and `tests:custom-with-wordpress` scripts allow you to run custom tests easily. Here are some examples:

> ‚ùï Notice how PHPUnit arguments come after `--`.

```sh
# Pick a test suite from the default phpunit.xml
npm run tests:custom -- -c phpunit.xml --testsuite Unit

# Create your own phpunit.*.xml (gitignored)
npm run tests:custom -- -c phpunit.custom.xml

# Run specific test class
npm run tests:custom-with-wordpress -- -c phpunit.xml --filter RevertTest
```

If you want to go entirely custom, use raw `docker-compose`:

```sh
# PhpStorm-like invocation (copy/pasted from its console):
docker-compose run --rm tests ../vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap /opt/versionpress/tests/phpunit-bootstrap.php --no-configuration /opt/versionpress/tests/Unit
```

#### Test output

Npm scripts are configured to log in a TestDox format to container's `/var/opt/versionpress/logs` which is mapped to your local folder `./dev-env/test-logs`.

To log in [another supported format](http://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/7.1/textui.html#command-line-options), run tests manually like this:

```
docker-compose run --rm tests ../vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.xml --log-junit /var/opt/versionpress/logs/vp-tests.log
```

#### Clean up tests

If you've run tests that use the `tests-with-wordpress` service, the whole Docker stack is kept running so that you can inspect it. For example, you can use your local Git client to explore the site's history in `dev-env/wp-for-tests/wptest`. The [end2end tests](#end2end-tests) section provides more info on this.

When you're done with tests, run `npm stop` to shut down the Docker stack or `npm run stop-and-cleanup` to also remove the volumes so that the next start is entirely fresh.

#### Tips for tests

- If you're trying to narrow down a bug, it's useful to run a smaller test suite via one of the options above and add `stopOnFailure="true"` to the XML file or `--stop-on-failure` on the command line.
- Unit tests can also easily be run using a local `php` interpreter, basically just run them in PhpStorm.

### Running and debugging tests from PhpStorm

PhpStorm makes it easy to select specific tests and to debug them. Also, if you stop debugging, you will see messages gathered so far. There is a one-time setup to go through.

> üí° If this doesn't work for you, e.g., due to some Docker Compose bug in PhpStorm, you can [start debugging from command line](#starting-debugging-session-from-command-line).

First, if you're using _Docker for Mac_ or _Docker for Windows_, expose a daemon in Docker settings:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27441580-43a964c8-576e-11e7-9912-1be811f73c4b.png)

In PhpStorm, create a new Docker environment in _Settings_ > _Build, Execution, Deployment_ > _Docker_:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27441828-ec760098-576e-11e7-9251-670204bf2643.png)

In the Docker panel, you should now be able to connect:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27441986-508eb2e6-576f-11e7-83b6-20e9b6944619.png)

Next, define a remote interpreter. Make sure you have the **PHP Docker** plugin enabled and go to *Settings* > *Languages & Frameworks* > *PHP*. Add a new interpreter there:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/40119446-04674760-591d-11e8-9a53-43f61eb7de5c.png)

Note that the `docker-compose.yml` is at the repo root, not inside `./plugins/versionpress`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/40119401-de795a66-591c-11e8-97cd-8c14e7a1976c.png)

If this doesn't go smoothly, try unchecking the _Include parent environment variables_ checkbox in the _Environment variables_ field:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27796503-81cff2f4-600a-11e7-8cfb-96661f0281a9.png)

Select this CLI interpreter as the main one for the project and make sure the path mappings are correct:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/40119974-51c4b528-591e-11e8-8d55-56fac37ffa18.png)

The final step is to set up a test framework in _PHP_ > _Test Frameworks_. Add a new _PHPUnit by Remote Interpreter_:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27797069-900fafce-600c-11e7-9ff9-db2d4507aa89.png)

Don't forget to set the _Default bootstrap file_ to `/opt/versionpress/tests/phpunit-bootstrap.php`.

Now you're ready to run the tests. For example, to run all unit tests, right-click the `Unit` folder and select _Run_:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27797266-48a041fc-600d-11e7-88f0-aa557eb02325.png)

Debugging also works, just select _Debug_ instead of _Run_:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27797346-93e132ca-600d-11e7-8052-9b4790739747.png)

This works equally well other types of tests as well, for example, Selenium tests:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/27797533-57f12904-600e-11e7-971b-08fd943aaf7b.png)

### Starting debugging session from command line

This method is more universal and works for PhpStorm, VSCode and other IDEs. You generally do this:

1. Set a breakpoint.
2. Start listening in your IDE.
3. Launch a debug-enabled script like `npm run tests:unit:debug` (see [package.json](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/blob/master/package.json)).

#### PhpStorm example

First, make sure you have the 'VersionPress-tests' server defined in _Settings > Languages & Frameworks > PHP > Servers_. If not, run `npm run init-phpstorm`.

Then, set a breakpoint in some test and start listening for debug connections in the toolbar.

Run `npm run tests:unit:debug` in the console, skip the first break at the `wp` binary and see your breakpoint hit:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/40370369-66eda84e-5de0-11e8-88f5-9792421a92ab.png)

See [this JetBrains help page](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PhpStorm/Debugging+PHP+CLI+scripts+with+PhpStorm) for more.

#### VSCode example

In VSCode, install [PHP Debug extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug) and create a `launch.json` config containing this:

```json
{
  "name": "PHP: Listen for Xdebug",
  "type": "php",
  "request": "launch",
  "port": 9000,
  "pathMappings": {
    "/opt/versionpress": "${workspaceRoot}/plugins/versionpress",
  }
}
```

Then, start a debugging session in VSCode and set a breakpoint. Run the `tests:unit:debug` script and see the breakpoint hit:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101152/40372175-7880a49a-5de4-11e8-9e87-adfb25d184ef.png)

### Unit tests

Unit tests are best suited for small pieces of algorithmic functionality. For example, `IniSerializer` is covered by unit tests extensively.

You can either run unit tests in a dockerized environment as described above or set up a local CLI interpret which makes the execution faster and more convenient.

### End2end tests

End2end tests exercise a WordPress site and check that VersionPress creates the right Git commits, that the database is in correct state, etc. These tests are quite heavy and slow to run but if they pass, there's a good chance that VersionPress works correctly. (Before the project had these, long and painful manual testing period was necessary before each release.)

End2end tests use the concept of **workers**: each test itself is implemented once but how e.g. a post is created or a user deleted is up to a specific worker. There are currently two types of workers:

1. **WP-CLI workers** ‚Äì run WP-CLI commands against the test site.
2. **Selenium workers** ‚Äì simulate real user by clicking in a browser.

In the future, we might add REST API workers; you get the idea.

Currently, the default worker is WP-CLI and the only way to switch workers is to update `tests/test-config.yml`, the `end2end-test-type` key. We'll make it more flexible in the future.

After you've run the tests, the Docker stack is left up and running so that you can inspect it:

- The site is running at <http://wordpress-for-tests/> ‚Äì [update your hosts file](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/) accordingly and log in using the info in `test-config.yml`.
- The files are mapped to `./dev-env/wp-for-tests`, you can use your local Git client to inspect it.
- Connect to the database via `mysql -u root -p` or Adminer which you can access by running `docker-compose run -d --service-ports adminer` and visiting <http://localhost:8099>. The database name is `mysql-for-wordpress`.

Stop the Docker stack with `npm run stop-and-cleanup` (stop-and-cleanup is strongly recommended here; end2end tests are not perfectly isolated yet).

### Other tests

The project has these other types of tests (folders in the `./plugins/versionpress/tests` folder and also test suite names in `phpunit.xml` so that you can run them using `--testsuite <SuiteName>`):

- `GitRepositoryTests` ‚Äì test Git repository manipulation in `GitRepository`.
- `SynchronizerTests` ‚Äì these are quite slow and test that given some INI files on disk, the database is in a correct state after synchronization runs.
- `StorageTests` ‚Äì test that entities are stored correctly as INI files.
- `LoadTests` ‚Äì they are run together with other tests but with very few iterations; manually update their source files and execute them separately to properly exercise them.
- `Selenium` ‚Äì a bit like end2end tests but for rarer cases, like VersionPress not being activated yet.
- `Workflow` ‚Äì exercise cloning and merging between environments.

## Frontend development

VersionPress uses a JavaScript frontend implemented as a React app in the `./frontend` folder.

### PhpStorm / WebStorm setup

1. Run `npm run init-phpstorm` if you haven't done that already.
2. Open the `frontend` project in PhpStorm.
3. Answer "No" to *Compile TypeScript to JavaScript?* prompt.

Linting task is set up for the frontend project. Run `npm run lint` in the `frontend` directory.

### Running frontend separately

For pure frontend development, it's more convenient to run it outside of the WordPress administration. Let's assume you run the frontend against the default Docker site.

1. Make sure that the site is running and that VersionPress is activated in it. You should be able to visit `http://localhost` in the browser and the `frontend/src/config/config.local.ts` should contain this URL as API root.
2. In your test WordPress site, put this to `wp-config.php` (the file should be editable at `./dev-env/wp/wp-config.php`):
    ```
    define('VERSIONPRESS_REQUIRE_API_AUTH', false);
    ```
3. Run `npm start` in the `frontend` directory.

This launches [webpack dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) at <http://localhost:8888>:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/26268495/c4738ff0-3cef-11e7-90ce-b807cc085865.png)

Source code edits will be automatically reflected in the browser.

## Production build

Run `npm run build`, it will produce a file like `dist/versionpress-3.0.2.zip`.

The version number is based on the nearest Git tag and can also be something like `3.0.2-27-g0e1ce7f` meaning that the closest tag is `3.0.2`, there have been 27 commits since then and the package was built from `0e1ce7f`. See [`git describe --tags`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-describe#_examples) for more examples.

## Developing the dev setup

Meta! If you're working on updating the dev setup (this document, Docker images, etc.), here are some tips for you.

### npm scripts

Simpler tasks are scripted directly in `package.json`, more complex ones in the `./scripts` folder, see for example `scripts/build.ts`.

To debug the scripts in VSCode, run the script via `debug-script`, e.g.:

```
npm run debug-script scripts/init-dev.ts
```

Then in VSCode, create a "Node attach" configuration and run it.

### Building and pushing images

We're keeping our images close to two [official ones](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/), [`wordpress:php7.2-apache`](https://github.com/docker-library/wordpress/blob/master/php7.2/apache/Dockerfile) and [`wordpress:cli`](https://github.com/docker-library/wordpress/blob/master/php7.2/cli/Dockerfile).

The only goal of our images is to be close to the official project and have the right environment in it, e.g., the PHP version. We don't care that much about specific WordPress versions (WordPress is often installed dynamically anyway, based on `test-config.yml`) so we only use "vague" tags like `php7.2-apache` or `cli`.

To build and push tags to Docker Hub:

1. `npm run build-images`
2. `docker login`
3. `npm run push-images`

You can get Docker Hub digests by running:

```
$ npm run get-image-digests

cli sha256:11c49ba4d7198c17660f30e8db4d00ca356b1c4414f338076bf99ab4dd295184
php7.2-apache sha256:39ed34f84a5ccf8ab47eb1db4041c226ffe6f874127ead4c26f0b607457b7377
```

### Links to older documents

Legacy approach is documented at the `4.0-alpha1` tag:

- [Dev-Setup.md](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/blob/4.0-alpha1/docs/Dev-Setup.md)
- [Testing.md](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/blob/4.0-alpha1/docs/Testing.md)

## Docker tips

Here are some tips for working with Docker / Docker Compose:

- Aliasing `docker-compose` to `dc` will save you some typing.
- Values in `docker-compose.yml` can be customized via `docker-compose.override.yml`.

## Windows tips

### Git Bash

As noted in [Getting started](#getting-started), we only support Git Bash on Windows, a shell that comes with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). `cmd.exe` or PowerShell will not work as we use Linux-style syntax (single quotes, setting environment variables, etc.) and tools like `curl` or `rm -rf` in scripts.

Git Bash is generally an awesome shell, the only problems you might encounter are related to paths. For example, Docker messes with them and when you try to run `docker run --rm -it ubuntu /bin/bash`, you'll see an error like `C:/Program Files/Git/usr/bin/bash.exe: no such file or directory`. Docker prepends `C:/Program Files/Git` for some reason but you can [use this workaround](https://gist.github.com/borekb/cb1536a3685ca6fc0ad9a028e6a959e3) or use double slash like `//bin/bash`.

### Docker for Windows

If you can, use [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows), not [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/). The experience will be generally smoother.

If you need to use Docker Toolbox:

- Enable port forwarding in VirtualBox (especially for ports 80, 3306, 8080 and 8099), see [details](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42866013/docker-toolbox-localhost-not-working/45822356#45822356).
- Docker Toolbox is slower, but you can try to adjust system performance in VirtualBox settings. However, you can run into timeout issues in Workflow tests sometimes and exceed default value of 5 seconds in `wp_remote_get()` in End2End tests.
- Run Git Bash and Docker Quickstart Terminal as an Administrator to avoid potential problems (for example permissions and symlinks).

### Disable antivirus software

You might want to disable your antivirus software when working with Docker. Recommendations differ between version, please look it up.
